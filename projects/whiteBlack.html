				white/black is an Othello/Reversi type game with the goal of having the majority of the discs in your color. You place your disc so that you have the opponents discs trapped between two of your discs in a straight line, the opponents discs are then flipped to your color.

					I designed and built this app as a side project with the main goal of learning about an layout technique called stack views. I also learned about a bit more advanced logic when figuring out what should happen when a player places a disk.  
					<br/>
					<br/>
					By observing people who've tried the app I've seen that people unfamiliar with Othello/Reversi found it difficult to know where to start or what to tap. Providing feedback by showing possible moves might help solve this.
