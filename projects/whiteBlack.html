				White vs black is an Othello/Reversi type game with the goal of having the majority of the disks in your color. You place your disk so that you have the opponents disks trapped between two of your disks in a straight line, the opponents disks are then flipped to your color.

					I designed and built this app as a side project with the main goal of learning about an layout technique called stack views. I learned a lot about stackviews and about a bit more advanced logic. Figuring out what should happen when a player places a disk.  
					<br/>
					<br/>
					By observing people who've tried the app I saw that people unfamiliar with Othello/Reversi found it difficult to know where to start or what to tap. Providing feedback by showing possible moves might help solve this.
