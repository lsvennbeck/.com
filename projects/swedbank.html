				Swedbank is facing increased competition from other banks and startups. New EU regulation is making banks open up API's to data like accounts and transactions. This means more competitiors and apps that collect all banks in stand alone apps.
				<br/><br/>
				In order to keep the customer relationship we need to make our app better. We've found that our customers want help understanding where their money goes, so we're improving a section of the app that does that. If we can do this well we believe it will help people choose our app over competitors'.
				<br/><br/>
				Customers really appreciate that we automatically categorize their transactions but say that it isn't granular enough because of the limited number of categories. So we implemented a new categorization engine and introduced more categories, going from x to y.

				We also designed insights about how you spend. Through concept testing in interviews and an online survey we learned that almost all participants wanted help with keeping track of small purchases. A coffee here, some snacks there, it really adds up. There was a lot more awareness around the bigger purchases like a new jacket that often had been more considered.
				<br/><br/>
				One thing that surprised us was that they wanted to see the basic expenses like rent, utilities and insurance. We had assumed that people already knew how much they spent on those things since they rarely change much from month to month. But several participants said that they weren't really aware since they were automatic transfers that goes under the radar. And if they'd see them, they'd think about finding cheaper alternatives.

				<strong>Process</strong>
				<br/>
				In order to learn what insights people wanted, we identified questions we wanted to answer and areas to explore. We designed concepts that we tested with customers in interviews. It helped us understand what they wanted to be on top off and get better at.
				<br/><br/>
				We put later iterations through several rounds of user testing, improving it after each round based on the feedback.

						We're soon shipping in beta and are also taking a step back to learn more about the big picture. Doing a research study around daily finances to identify needs, goals and attitudes that will help us redesign the startpage of the app (and eventually the whole app) in a more customer centered way.
