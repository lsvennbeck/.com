				Algo is an A.I. that uses machine learning to predict soccer games. We made it feel high tech to make people trust its predictions, at the same time human by giving predictions in plain english with personality. Easy for both hardcore stat crunchers and newbies wanting to be able to talk about soccer.

				We designed the app and built the backend + machine learning services but put it on hold when my collaborator's football analytics as a service company took off. It uses the same technology and now have several Swedish and international clubs as well as Swedish TV 4 as customers.
