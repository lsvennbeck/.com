				workBreak is a productivity app that uses the pomodoro technique; work for a set time, break for a set time, repeat.

					I had used the technique using a timer but felt that it was disturbing my flow when I had to restart the timer after each period. So I designed and built an app that let you know when it's time to switch (a voice tells you and the screen flashes) and automatically transitions between work and break. It has dramatically increased my productivity by reducing friction and increasing focus. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					When I do sideprojects like this I try to combine building a focused, useful product (irregardless if similar exists) and learning specific things about programming and app development. This app helped me learn about layout constraints, visual layout formatting, animation and custom controls. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					After I had completed the app I learned that I had been doing the layout in a unnecessarily complex way by not using stack views (another layout technique), so for my next project my goal was to learn how to do layout using stack views.
