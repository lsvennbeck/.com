			<p>
            I design products, services and help companies become more human centered. I do design research, strategy, UX, visual design and code. I start from people's needs and goals but also consider economical viability and technical feasibility.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've come up with ideas for new games with Playstation, developed digital strategy for kitchens with IKEA, prototyped a new food delivery service, piloted a hotel experience with Crown Plaza, built tools for people in poverty with the CFPB and shipped apps as an independent developer/designer.
            <br>
            <br>
            I care about a sustainable future, electric vehicles and renewable energy.⚡️
