			<p>
				I design products and services. I'm looking to design everything from what it is and how it works, to how it looks and feels.
				<br>
				<br>
				I believe designing great experiences starts with understanding people's needs, goals and attitudes. Rapidly prototyping, testing and iterating to create something people want. I believe in brutal simplicity and laser-shark focus, in getting it right, instead of getting everything in.
				<br>
				<br>
				I think holistically - software, hardware, brand, organisation, business strategy and people all has to come together. Hitting the sweet spot between being desirable by people, economically viable and technologically feasible. ðŸ‘Œ
				<br>
				<br>
				I've worked in several industries; defined the offer for a new bank, prototyped a food delivery service, designed a kitchen buying experience, defined directions for videogames, piloted a hotel experience and built tools for people in poverty.
				<br>
				<br>
				In my spare time I work on side projects, learn Swift and iOS development, write a book on design principles and follow the development of electric vehicles and renewable energy.
