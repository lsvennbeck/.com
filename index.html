			<p>
				I'm a generalist product/service designer. I do UX, research, strategy, visual and code.
				<br>
				<br>
				I believe designing great experiences starts with understanding people's needs, goals and attitudes. Rapidly prototyping, testing and iterating to create something people want. I believe in brutal simplicity and laser-shark focus, in getting it right, instead of getting everything in.
				<br>
				<br>
				I think holistically - software, hardware, brand, organisation, business and people all has to come together. Hitting the sweet spot between being desirable by people, economically viable and technologically feasible. ðŸ‘Œ
				<br>
				<br>
				I've worked in several industries; defined the offer for a new bank, prototyped a food delivery service, designed a kitchen buying experience, created directions for videogames, piloted a hotel experience and built tools for people in poverty.
				<br>
				<br>
				In my spare time I'm learning Swift and iOS development, writing a book on design principles and following the development of electric vehicles and renewable energy.
