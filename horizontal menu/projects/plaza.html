				Ignition is an innovative new meeting and working experience, housed in the lobby of Crowne Plaza hotels that incorporates an integrated new suite of brand, space, furniture, service role, food and beverage offers, digital tools, and business strategy. The concept is designed to increase travelers productivity and launched with two pilots in Atlanta. It's now being rolled out across the Americas as part of a 200 million dollar investment.
