	<h2> About </h2> 


	I design products &amp; and services. Looking to design products from start to finish. Starting with user research and strategy, prototyping and testing to define the product, designing how it works, looks and feels all the way to shipping and continued iteration.
					<br>
					<br>
					I believe designing great experiences starts with understanding people's needs, desires and context. Rapidly prototyping to learn, iterate and create something people want. I believe in brutal simplicity and laser-shark focus when designing products, in getting it right, instead of getting everything in.
					<br>
					<br>
					I think holistically about designing experiences. Software, hardware, brand, organisation, business strategy and people all has to come together. Trying to hit the sweet spot between being desirable by people, economically viable and technologically feasible. ðŸ‘Œ
<p>
We make sure everyone has everything they need to do great work. Then we start by trying to understand the people we're designing for, what problems they have and what they're interested in. Learn what constraints exist and remove the ones that aren't helpful. Exploring ideas by building small things that can be tested with the people we design for. From the learnings we make changes and test again, when it's good enough we make it real and share it. 
<br>
<br>
We look at how people use it and listen to what they think could be better. Then listen some more. Trying things out to make it better. We do it over and over because it's never finished. We do it because we want to make things better, learn new things and make things for other people.

Worked across multiple industries: I've prototyped a food delivery service, developed strategy for a new bank, designed a new kitchen buying experience, defined a new set of video games, piloted a new hotel experience and built tools for the 200 million in poverty in the US.
